# dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter
Integrate Shelly 3EM smart meter into Victron Energies Venus OS

## Purpose
With the scripts in this repro it should be easy possible to install, uninstall, restart a service that connects the Shelly 3EM to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.
Idea is pasend on @RalfZim project linked below
